## So why `mineweave`?

I found it very tedious to set up a Minecraft modding environment. I had to copy over my old projects and make the necessary changes to then start modding. I wanted to automate this process and make it easier for others to start modding. That's why I created `mineweave`.

MineWeave saves you from long,boring setup processes; skipping all the repetitive steps and getting you straight to the fun part of modding. No more wasted time on setup â€“ just pure, creative modding.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

### Using Cargo

If you have rust installed, you can install MineWeave using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install mineweave
```

### Using the binary

You can download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/phrogwrld/mineweave/releases/latest) and add it to your PATH.

## Usage

To create a new modding environment, run the following command:

```bash
mineweave
```

You will then be prompted to enter information about your mod. Once you have entered all the information, MineWeave will generate the modding environment for you.
